# game_of_colors

A simple modification to Conway's game of life that extends the rules to three colors: red, green and blue; also adds white as aa fusion of all three

A cell becomes white if it is of one color and there are two other colors neighboring it, however white cells are unstable and turn to the color that dominates among its neighbors if one of three is missing.
